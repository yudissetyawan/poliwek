        <h3>Surface parameters</h3>
        <p>
          Very often, mechanical designs for workpieces include specifications
          for defined parameters such as surface roughness or ripple. Polytec
          TopMap surface metrology based on the white-light interferometry
          principle acquire entire non-contact 3D areal data in just seconds,
          where tactile methods would require much longer measuring times. Both
          2D and 3D areal parameters (ISO 25178-2, ISO 4287, ISO 4288) – can be
          determined quickly and easily. 3D areal surface metrology can offer a
          visual representation of how a surface looks in detail and give a very
          precise numerical representation, indicating heights and sizes for
          example. Although these scales may be very small they often provide
          information that directly relates back to how the surface was
          generated, how to maintain engineering quality or the identification
          of manufacture defects and failures. Using this measurement feedback
          allows process control, leading to high quality and consistency of
          functional and engineered surfaces.

          <h2>Form parameters</h2>
          <p>
            Whenever producing a workpiece, the tiniest details, the tightest
            manufacturing tolerances, especially in the area of technical,
            functional and precision surfaces, all can influence the performance
            of the surface. Here, manufacturers must precisely inspect and
            quantify the many different form tolerances, such as shape, size and
            texture as well as other positional tolerances such as parallelism
            and angles to ensure that all critical dimensions meet the required
            specifications. TopMap surface metrology is specifically developed
            to meet the most demanding tolerancing of precision-made components.

          </div>
          <h2>Flatness and parallelism</h2>
          <p>
            In the case of functional surfaces, it is often crucial to measure
            specific parameters such as flatness and parallelism of
            precision-made components like fuel injectors or sealing surfaces in
            pumps. Such surfaces are designed to perform under high pressure and
            need to be well made, consistently made and constantly checked for
            quality as integral step within the manufacturing process. Polytec's
            TopMap optical 3D measurement systems are specifically designed for
            automation and ease of use, providing precise measurement data as
            reliable feedback for the production process. TopMap allows for the
            accurate characterization of parallelism and flatness over a large
            field-of-view (FoV) directly at production level and in quality
            control laboratories, thus, enabling fast and comprehensive
            characterization of critical components

          <h2>Heights and steps</h2>
          <p>
            The 3D inspection of step height, angles and the interaction between
            surfaces often requires a large vertical measuring range. TopMap
            whitelight-interferometry offers a large vertical measuring range up
            to 70 mm and more depending on the models. This large vertical range
            allows measuring both small and large step heights, even on surfaces
            that are difficult to access, like deeply recessed surfaces. TopMap
            feature a telecentric optical design, avoiding shadowing effects
            while offering the reliably measurement of critical nano, micro or
            macro step heights. Automatic software such as pattern recognition
            help optimize data processing and help eliminate the need for
            complex mechanical fixturing of workpieces. This enhanced automation
            significantly increases speed, throughput, and data quality.

          </div>
          <h2>Roughness</h2>
          <p>
            In quality control, research, product development and production,
            the exact and stable measurement of surface roughness is often
            decisive for maintaining quality. The traditional profile parameters
            tend to be 2D. Referred to as “R” parameters these roughness
            parameters are well established and well understood. Here, the 3D
            areal “S” parameters work as a supplement since functional surface
            interactions require areal analysis. Surface topography is 3D in
            nature. A single line profile cannot identify pits or valleys, peaks
            or ridges. Any measurement and analysis of profiles or sections,
            even if properly controlled, will only give an incomplete
            description of the real surface topography. The information provided
            by areal surface topography is far more comprehensive. TopMap 3D
            surface metrology from Polytec provides both 2D and 3D areal
            parameters according to ISO 25178-2, ISO 4287, ISO 4288.

          </div>
          <h2>Microstructures</h2>
          <p>
            Microstructures are very small structures, very often difficult to
            see with the human eye. The functionality of these surface types can
            be influenced by small physical changes of defects at micrometer and
            nanometer levels. Therefore, high-resolution surface inspection is
            an important aspect of surface characterization in the field of
            microsystems technology. TopMaps range of microscope-based surface
            profilers offer a fast, non-invasive inspection of surface details
            with excellent repeatability. TopMap optical 3D surface metrology is
            your best choice for reliable, stable characterization of micro and
            nano devices, micro-structured and complex surfaces and
            microsystems.

          <h2>Layer thickness</h2>
          <p>
            Wherever coating thickness is to be determined, whether in the
            laboratory, at production level or even in production lines, Polytec
            can offer layer thickness and or multi-layer thickness measurement
            solutions. All, in a non-contact and non-destructive way. The areas
            of application for layer thickness inspection are diverse and range
            from film thickness, to coating inspection or analysis of wear on
            coated surfaces like, automotive, aerospace or medical components
            with functional surfaces. The TopMap non-contact optical measurement
            systems are also used in numerous industries, to help enhance
            production and aid product research and development.

        <h3>Table of surface parameter ISO standards</h3>
        <p>
          The mathematical description of numerous surface parameters can be
          found in various international standards. In practical application,
          ISO 4287 and ISO 13565 for 2D parameters and ISO 25178 for areal
          surface roughness are of particular importance. These standards define
          and describe the commonly used texture parameters. For the large
          number of parameters from profile standards, an equivalent areal
          parameter can be found in the published standard. Beyond that, areal
          topography evaluation offers additional benefit due to third
          dimension.
        </p>
        <p>
          The amplitude or height surface parameters frequently used in practice
          were mostly extended to the areal evaluation. The areal evaluation of
          the topography shows the advantage of the measuring position being
          less sensitive than in profile-based evaluations, thus providing more
          reliable measurement results, especially for inhomogeneous and
          defective surfaces. However, the surface parameter family as a whole
          has in common that they cannot represent the functional differences
          between different types of surfaces. This means that differently
          manufactured and designed surfaces might still show the same results
          with respect to the surface parameters.
