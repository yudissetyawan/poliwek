        <h3>Laser Doppler vibrometry</h3>
        <p>
          Laser Doppler vibrometry (LDV) is currently the method that offers the
          best displacement and velocity resolution and is used in many fields
          of basic science. It enables femtometer amplitude resolution and is
          linear and therefore has a consistent amplitude right up to the very
          high frequency ranges – practically reaching more than 2 GHz at
          present. These properties are independent of the measuring distance,
          so this principle is used both in microscopic operations and over very
          large distances. Light as a sensor does not influence the sample,
          making it non-invasive and therefore enabling measurements to be
          carried out on extremely small and extremely lightweight structures.
          Since this procedure offers such unbeatable properties, Polytec has
          made it robust and fit for use in both the laboratory and outdoors.

        <h3>The Doppler effect</h3>
        <p>
          If a wave is reflected by a moving object and detected by an
          instrument (as is the case with the LDV), the measured frequency shift
          of the wave can be described as:
        </p>
        <p><span class="p-bold">fD = 2· v/λ</span></p>
        <p>
          where v is the object’s velocity and λ is the wavelength of the
          emitted wave. To be able to conversely determine the velocity of an
          object, the (Doppler) frequency shift has to be measured at a known
          wavelength. This is done in the LDV by using a laser interferometer.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col1">
      <div class="content">
        <h3>Interferometry</h3>
        <p>
          The laser Doppler vibrometer works on the basis of optical
          interference, whereby essentially two coherent light beams, with their
          respective light intensities I1 and I2, are required to overlap. The
          total intensity of both beams is not just the sum of the single
          intensities, but is modulated according to the formula:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="p-bold"
            >Itot = I1 + I2 + 2 √(I1 I2) cos [2π(r1 - r2)/λ]</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          with a so-called “interference” term. This interference term relates
          to the path length difference between both beams. If this difference
          is an integer multiple of the light wavelength, the total intensity is
          four times a single intensity.

        <h3>Optical setup of laser Doppler vibrometry</h3>
        <p>
          The schematic image above shows how this physical law is exploited
          technically in the LDV.
        </p>
        <p>
          The beam of a laser is split by a beam splitter (BS 1) into a
          reference beam and a measurement beam. After passing through a second
          beam splitter (BS 2), the measurement beam is focused onto the sample,
          which reflects it. This reflected beam is now deflected downwards by
          BS 2 (see figure), and is then merged with the reference beam onto the
          detector.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the optical path of the reference beam is constant over time (r2 =
          const.) (with the exception of negligible thermal effects on the
          interferometer), a movement of the sample (r1 = r(t)) generates a
          light / dark pattern, typical of interferometry, on the detector. One
          complete light / dark cycle on the detector corresponds to an object
          displacement of exactly half of the wavelength of the light used. In
          the case of the helium neon laser often used for vibrometers, this
          corresponds to a displacement of 316 nm.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col1">
      <div class="content">
        <h3>The Doppler frequency shift</h3>
        <p>
          Changing the optical path length per unit of time manifests itself as
          the measurement beam’s Doppler frequency shift. In metrological terms,
          this means that the modulation frequency of the interferometer pattern
          determined is directly proportional to the velocity of the sample. As
          object movement away from the interferometer generates the same
          modulation pattern (and modulation frequencies) as object movement
          towards the interferometer, this set-up alone cannot unambiguously
          determine the direction the object is moving in. For this purpose, an
          acousto-optic modulator (Bragg cell) that typically shifts the light
          frequency by 40 MHz is placed in the reference beam (for comparison
          purposes, the laser light’s frequency is 4.74 · 1014 Hz). This
          generates a typical interference pattern modulation frequency of 40
          MHz when the sample is at a standstill. If the object then moves
          towards the interferometer, this modulation frequency is increased,
          and if it moves away from the interferometer, the detector receives a
          frequency less than 40 MHz. This means that it is now possible to not
          only clearly detect the path length, but also the direction of
          movement too.

        <h3>Displacement or velocity of vibrations</h3>
        <p>
          In principle, it is possible to directly measure displacements as well
          as velocities with the LDV. In this case, the Doppler frequency is not
          transformed into a voltage proportional to velocity; instead, the LDV
          counts the light / dark fringes on the detector. Using suitable
          interpolation techniques, Polytec’s vibrometers can thus attain a
          resolution of 2 nm, and with digital demodulation techniques this can
          even be extended as far down as the pm range. Displacement
          demodulation is better suited to low frequency measurements (in the
          sub Hz range), while velocity demodulation is better for higher
          frequencies, since the maximum amplitudes of harmonic vibrations can
          be expressed as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="p-bold">v = 2π • f • s</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          As its frequency increases, a vibration generates a relatively high
          velocity at a very low displacement amplitude.
